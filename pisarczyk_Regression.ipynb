    "expert in the field of medicine and can help them get better. In general, experts simply know more about\n",

    "To test if experts are susceptible to overclaiming, Atir, Rosenzweig, and Dunning (2015) recruited 202\n",

    "of knowledge in the area of personal finance. The overclaiming task asked participants to indicate how\n",
    "much they knew about 15 terms related to personal finance (e.g., home equity). Included in the 15 items\n",
    "were three terms that do not actually exist (e.g., annualized credit). Thus, overclaiming occurred when\n",
    "participants said that they were knowledgeable about the non-existent terms. Finally, participants\n",
