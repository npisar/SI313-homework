    "Valuing expertise is important for modern life. When people have a problem, they need to know who to\n",
    "turn to for a solution to their problem. For example, when people get sick, they know that a doctor is an\n",
    "expert in the field of medicine and can help them get better. In general, experts simply know more about\n",
    "a topic than do non-experts. However, experts may be vulnerable to a particular problem of knowing so\n",
    "much. They may have the illusion that they know more about a topic than they actually do.\n",
    "\n",

    "To test if experts are susceptible to overclaiming, Atir, Rosenzweig, and Dunning (2015) recruited 202\n",

    "much they knew about 15 terms related to personal finance (e.g., home equity). Included in the 15 items\n",
    "were three terms that do not actually exist (e.g., annualized credit). Thus, overclaiming occurred when\n",
    "participants said that they were knowledgeable about the non-existent terms. Finally, participants\n",
