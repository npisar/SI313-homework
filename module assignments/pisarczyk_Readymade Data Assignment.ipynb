    "\n",
    "**BEFORE YOU START:**\n",
    "1. Read the assignment instructions on Canvas carefully.\n",
    "2. Make a copy of this notebook and work on your own copy.\n",
    "3. Understand the dataset before you start cleaning and analyzing. NYC Open Data has a nice portal and a data dictionary for exploring their datasets.\n",
    "4. NYC 311 is a **very large** dataset. When you are fetching data from the portal or API, we would recommend you to first think about your research questions and start with a small subset of the data and then increase the size of the data as you get more comfortable with the data. Generally, you do **not** need to use the entire dataset to answer your research question.\n",
    "5. This notebook serves as a template. You can add more cells or make adjustments as you see fit. But make sure to keep all the sections mentioned in the assignment instructions. Also, format your notebook properly for better readability."

    "- Where you obtained the data (URL or API endpoint)\n",
    "```\n",
    "I didn't want to download a bunch of data that wasn't necessary for the RQ I chose, so I started with the API calls. I could filter the columns of data I wanted to use, and I had a lot more granular control over the data in a way I was already pretty comfortable with. I downloaded data per borough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I gathered the data from the API, I saved each borough's data to pandas df objects, put all the dfs in a dictionary to be able to access easily later, and saved each of those dfs to csv files. Then, I went forward and read each CSV data file instead of calling the API over and over.\n",

    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is the list of columns I used (see in context in Option B first cell how I filtered). I figured that to understand if 'different neighborhoods have distinctive patterns in their 311 service requests' and to 'Analyze the relative frequency of complaint types across neighborhoods', all I needed were the complaint type, some descriptors, the borough, and the basic unique key / created/closed date information. I tried to take only the necessary columns to keep the API calls short and filesizes small. I don't need most of the stuff available in the data!\n",

    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "Some more code. I filtered on created_date and did that above date (only records after 2025-06-01), and then filtered by borough as I was iterating through the list (see in context in Option B's first cell). I used a limit of 250,000 because I wanted to gather around 100,000 records for Staten Island. Since Staten Island naturally has fewer 311 datapoints (as it's essentially a tourist island compared to the other 4 urban city boroughs), I thought this was a good balance of not having a ridiculous number of rows and crazy filesizes, but still having plenty of data to analyze and generalize with. \n",

    "**Overview**\n",
    "This assignment asks you to analyze NYC 311 service request data to understand patterns in urban neighborhoods. You will use Python to explore relationships between service requests and socioeconomic characteristics, practicing skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "311 systems allow residents to report non-emergency issues like noise complaints, street conditions, and building problems. As Wang et al. (2017) demonstrated, these service request patterns can reveal distinctive “signatures” of urban neighborhoods that correlate with demographic and economic characteristics.\n",

    "- Practice working with “readymade” administrative data from government sources\n",
    "- Develop skills in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis\n",
    "- Apply statistical methods to understand relationships in observational data\n",
    "- Create effective visualizations to communicate data patterns\n",
    "- Consider methodological limitations and ethical implications of using administrative data for research\n",

    "\n",
    "Recommended approach: Explore the dataset using the NYC Open Data online portal and the data dictionary. The full dataset is very large (40+ million records), so filtering is essential. For instance, one year of data was around 2.6 GB. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your research question, identify an appropriate subset of the data (e.g., one year of data for specific boroughs or zip codes), and use the Socrata API or directly download it.You can find more information about the API and the documentation on NYC Open Data website.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Option 2: Temporal Patterns in Service Requests\n",
    "<br>How do 311 service requests vary by time of day, day of week, or season? Are there particular complaint types that show strong temporal patterns? What might explain these patterns?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Option 3: Response Time Disparities\n",
    "<br>Do response times for 311 requests differ across neighborhoods or complaint types? Calculate the time between request creation and closure, and examine whether there are systematic differences by location or complaint category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Option 4: Complaint Type Evolution\n",

    "- Data loading and initial exploration: Load the data, explain how you retrieve the data, why you choose the specific subset, examine its structure, and identify relevant variables\n",
    "- Data cleaning: Handle missing values, filter to relevant records, create derived variables as needed\n",
    "- Exploratory analysis: Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand patterns\n",
    "- Focused analysis: Apply appropriate statistical methods to address your research question\n",
    "- Visualizations: Create at least 3 meaningful visualizations (e.g., time series, bar charts, heatmaps, scatter plots)\n",
    "- Documentation: Include markdown cells explaining your approach, interpreting results, and noting limitations\n",
    "- Technical expectations: Use numpy/pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization, and appropriate statistical libraries (scipy, statsmodels, etc.) as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Written Summary<br>\n",
    "Briefly report on the following. Your notebook should have a section for each bullet point.\n",

    "- Methods: Describe your data source, cleaning steps, and analytical approach\n",
    "- Findings: Summarize key patterns and statistical results (include 2-3 key visualizations)\n",
    "- Limitations: What are the methodological limitations? What can and cannot be concluded from this analysis?\n",
    "- Ethical considerations: Reflect on the use of 311 data for research. Who is represented? Who might be excluded? What are potential concerns about using this data?\n",
